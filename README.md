Serverless Assignment from X 

The goal of this task was given to setup a serverless application on a CircleCI environment. The main objective is to create an AWS Lambda function using serverless framework and output a txt file with date and time as the content into a specific bucket. On top of that, any changes/commit to this repository must also trigger the build pipeline in the CircleCI.

There are few learning curves for this exercise too as this is the first time I've used the Serverless framework and CircleCI. However I have few years of CI/CD experience on Jenkins and custom build of data application; therefore I only pick up the syntax for the framework and usage of the new CI platform. It was really fun learning them. 

In summary, I enjoy doing tasks such as this one; Tinkering to build something like this is always my passion and motivated to more in the future.
